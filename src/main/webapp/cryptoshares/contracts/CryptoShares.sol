*
* 'CryptoSharesFactory' is a smart contract for creating smart contract for cryptoshares.
* They can be shares of a real corporation. Every share is an ERC20 + ERC223 Token.
* Smart contracts with cryptoshares implement:
* 1) Shareholders identity verification (via Cryptonomica.net) and shareholders ledger.
* 2) Automatic signing of arbitration clause (dispute resolution agreement) by every new shareholder.
* 3) Shareholders voting using 'one share - one vote' principle.
* 4) Dividends distribution. Dividends can be paid in xEUR tokens (https://xeuro.online) and/or in Ether.
* Smart contract can receive Ether and xEUR and distribute them to shareholders.
* Shares can be transferred  without restrictions from one Ethereum address to another. But only verified Ethereum
* address represents shareholder. Every share not owned by registered shareholder address are considered 'in transfer',
* shares 'in transfer' can not vote and can not receive dividends.
*
* 'CryptoSharesFactory' charges fee in Ether for creating cryptoshares smart contracts.

    /* ============= VOTING ================ */

    /*
    * This smart contract implements voting for shareholders of ERC20 tokens based on the principle
    * "one share - one vote"
    * It requires external script to count votes.
    *
    * Rules:
    * To start a voting an address have to own at lest one share.
    * To start a voting, voting creator must provide:
    * 1) text of the proposal,
    * 2) number of the block on which voting will be finished and results have to be calculated.
    *
    * Every proposal for a contract receives a sequence number that serves as a proposal ID.
    * To vote 'for' or 'against' voter has to provide proposal ID.
    *
    * In most scenarios only votes 'for' can be used, who did not voted 'for' can be considered as voted 'against'.
    * But our dApp also supports votes 'against'
    *
    * To calculate results we collect all voted addresses by an external script, which is also open sourced.
    * Than we check their balances in tokens on resulting block, and and sum up the voices.
    * Thus, for the results, the number of tokens of the voter at the moment of voting does not matter
    * (it should just has at least one).
    * What matters is the number of tokens on the voter's address on the block where the results should calculated.
    *
    * It's like https://www.cryptonomica.net/eth-vote/, but:
    * 1) for this contract only
    * 2) to start voting or to vote an address has to be registered as a shareholder, not just to have tokens
