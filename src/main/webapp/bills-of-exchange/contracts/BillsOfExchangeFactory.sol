*
* 1) Convention providing a Uniform Law for Bills of Exchange and Promissory Notes (Geneva, 7 June 1930):
* https://www.jus.uio.no/lm/bills.of.exchange.and.promissory.notes.convention.1930/doc.html
* https://treaties.un.org/Pages/LONViewDetails.aspx?src=LON&id=552&chapter=30&clang=_en
*
* 2) U.K. Bills of Exchange Act 1882:
* http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/45-46/61/section/3
*
* and as a 'draft' according to
* U.S. Uniform Commercial Code
* https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/3-104
*
* see more on: https://github.com/Cryptonomica/cryptonomica/wiki/electronic-bills-of-exchange
*
* Bills of exchange created with this smart contract are payable to the bearer,
* and can be transferred using Ethereum blockchain (from one blockchain address to another)
