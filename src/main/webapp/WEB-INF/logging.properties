# A default java.util.logging configuration.
# (All App Engine logging is through java.util.logging by default).
#
# To use this configuration, copy it into your application's WEB-INF
# folder and add the following to your appengine-web.xml:
# 
# <system-properties>
#   <property name="java.util.logging.config.file" value="WEB-INF/logging.properties"/>
# </system-properties>
#
# Set the default logging level for all loggers to WARNING
.level=WARNING
# --- !!! it seems, that it does not work, to have log messages to be shown in GAE logs,
# --- we have to set their level to WARNING manually
