# Due diligence and KYC

The purpose of user due diligence is to prevent the use of assets and property obtained in a criminal manner in the economic activities of credit institutions and financial institutions and in the services provided by them whose goal is to prevent the exploitation of the financial system and economic space of the United Kingdom and European Union for money laundering and terrorist financing. 

User due diligence is aimed, first and foremost, at applying the [Know-Your-Customer (KYC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer) principle, under which a user shall be identified and the appropriateness of transactions shall be assessed based on the users’s principal business and prior pattern of payments. In addition, user due diligence serves to identify unusual circumstances in the operations of a user or circumstances whereby an employee of the Company has reason to suspect money laundering or terrorist financing.

Requirement for the measures of prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing is that the Company does not enter into transactions or establish relationships with anonymous or unidentified persons. Legislation requires that the Company waives a transaction or the establishment of a business relationship if a person fails to provide sufficient information to identify the person or about the purpose of the transactions or if the operations of the person involve a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. Also, the Company may terminate a continuing contract without the advance notification term if the person fails to submit sufficient information for application of user due diligence measures.

Under current law the Company has the right, taking account the special requirements and restrictions provided by law, to use the services of a third party under a contract the subject of which is the continuing performance of activities and continued taking of steps required for the provision of (a) service(s) by the Company to its customers/users and that would normally be performed and taken by the Company itself. For the purposes of this section, third parties include, for instance, agents, subcontractors and other persons to whom the Company transfers the activities relating to the provision of the services provided as a rule by the Company in its economic activities.

*The user must take into account that, given the legal obligations of the Company, the Company should keep personal information of the users, and such information cannot be removed or deleted by user’s request*

User has legal obligation to inform the Company is, he/she is:
* a politically exposed person;
* a person whose place of residence or seat is in a country where no sufficient measures for prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing have been taken;
* a person with regard to whose activities there is prior suspicion that the person may be involved in money laundering or terrorist financing;
* a person with regard to whom international sanctions are imposed;

The Company may waive a transaction or the establishment of a business relationship if a person fails to provide sufficient information to identify the person or if the operations of the person involve a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. Also, legislation requires the Company to terminate a continuing contract without the advance notification term if the person fails to submit sufficient information for application of user due diligence measures.
