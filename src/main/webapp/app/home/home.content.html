<h2 id="what-is-cryptonomica">What is Cryptonomica?</h2>

<p>Cryptonomica is an online and offline identity verification service
    and a global database of verified identities with keys for signing electronic documents, blockchain transactions and
    KYC.
</p>

<p>We also provide online dispute resolution for contracts signed with verified keys via London based arbitration
    with awards (decisions) legally enforceable under international law in almost all countries.
</p>

<p>Our mission is to use modern technologies such as cryptography,
    blockchain, decentralized applications, and international law with some law hacks,
    to build global borderless space for contracts and electronic documents interchange, where applicable law can be
    chosen
    and even created by users, but contracts are still recognizable and enforceable in legacy national legal
    systems.
</p>

<h2 id="why-it-s-useful-for-me-">Why it's useful for me?</h2>

<p>With Cryptonomica you can generate, upload to global database and verify your cryptographic key (OpenPGP standard),
    and use these keys to sign legally binding documents, encrypt your communication, resolve disputes online with rules
    you choose - faster and more comfortable than ever.
</p>

<p>You also can verify identity of Ethereum address/key owner, and use it for transactions on the blockchain
    (smart contracts, verified payments etc.)
</p>

<h2 id="how-is-it-different-from-docusign-adobesign-and-local-digital-signature-services-">How is it different from
    DocuSign, AdobeSign, and local digital signature services?</h2>

<p>We provide real identity check. As much verification as possible. We have notaries connected to our system and we
    have our officers/representatives in different countries for face-to-face person identification.
    We use best security practices and reliable open source cryptography. And, unlike national digital signatures
    services, it's global.
