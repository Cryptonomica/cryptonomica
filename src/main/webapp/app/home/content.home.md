## What is Cryptonomica?

Cryptonomica is an online and offline identity verification service 
and a global database of verified identities with keys for signing electronic documents, blockchain transactions and KYC.  

We also provide online dispute resolution for contracts signed with verified keys via London based arbitration 
with awards (decisions) legally enforceable under international law in almost all countries.

Our mission is to use modern technologies such as cryptography, 
blockchain, decentralized applications, and international law with some law hacks, 
to build global borderless space for contracts and electronic documents interchange, where applicable law can be chosen 
and even created by users, but contracts are still recognizable and enforceable in legacy national legal systems.

## Why it's useful for me?
                                
With Cryptonomica you can generate, upload to global database and verify your cryptographic key (OpenPGP standard),
and use these keys to sign legally binding documents, encrypt your communication, resolve disputes online with rules you choose - faster and more comfortable than ever.

You also can verify identity of Ethereum address/key owner, and use it for transactions on the blockchain 
(smart contracts, verified payments etc.)

## How is it different from Docusign, Adobesign, and local digital signature services?

We provide real identity check. As much verification as possible. We have notaries connected to our system and we have 
our officers/representatives in different countries for face-to-face person identification. 
We use best security practices and reliable open source cryptography. And, unlike national digital signatures services, it's global.

-------------------------------------

Cryptonomica keys server provide for it's user information about registered Cryptonomica members
and their verified public [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) keys.


## To become member of Cryptonomica:

1) Generate your [OpenPGP](https://github.com/Cryptonomica/cryptonomica/wiki/Public-PGP-Key) keys using our [our online service](https://cryptonomica.net/#!/openPGPOnline) or
[recommended software](https://github.com/Cryptonomica/arbitration-rules/blob/master/Arbitration_Rules/IACC/web-site/list.of.recommended.OpenPGP.software.md).
Public PGP Key should have one user ID with fist name, last name and user e-mail.
E-mail in the key should be the same as in Google account, that you use to login to Cryptonomica server
(you can have Google account with any e-mail, or just use [gmail.com](https://mail.google.com) )

We do not store and never touch your private key,
you should generate your key on device that only you have access to,
protect it with password and never send it via Internet or public networks.

2) Press 'Register' ('Login/Register') button and login with Google account.

3) Upload your public PGP Key and information about you.

4) Verify your uploaded key.
To verify your key online find your key information page via your profile or via key search,
and click 'Verify Online' green button, then follow instructions.
For offline verification you have to contact Cryptonomica accredited notary (click 'Show notaries' tab in user menu)
or authorized Cryptonomica officer (write to support@cryptonomica.net),
and meet him/her in person, and provide appropriate documents (passport or other ID document)


### Using verified user's public key you can:

1. Verify his/her signature on contract or another legally binding documents.
Signature done with verified key is considered as user's own signature on document in arbitration tribunal
under our [Arbitration Rules](https://github.com/Cryptonomica/arbitration-rules/blob/master/Arbitration_Rules/IACC/IACC-Arbitration-Rules.EN.signed.md),
and thus such contract, agreement or obligation will be *legally* recognizable and enforceable in all counties - parties of
[The New York Convention 1958](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Recognition_and_Enforcement_of_Foreign_Arbitral_Awards) (currently [156](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Recognition_and_Enforcement_of_Foreign_Arbitral_Awards#Parties_to_the_Convention))

2. Encrypt a message (any file) to key's owner, that only he/she can decrypt it.

3. File a case for online dispute resolution in our online arbitration.
Cryptonomica Ltd. is a permanent arbitration court registered in London, U.K.,
providing online dispute resolution using modern information technologies.

To file a case just send your claim (notice of arbitration) by email to registrar@international-arbitration.org.uk
