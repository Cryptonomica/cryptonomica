## What is Cryptonomica?

Cryptonomica is the global database of verified identities with service for signing electronic documents and online 
dispute resolution.

## Why it's useful for me?
                                
With Cryptonomica you can generate and upload your public cryptographic key (OpenPGP standard) to global database, 
and add to this key verified data about key owner, i.e. about you. Than you can use your key to securely sign documents 
worldwide, to encrypt documents, to resolve disputes online - faster and more comfortable than ever.

## How is it different from Docusign, Adobesign, and local digital signature services?

We provide real identity check. As much verification as possible. We have notaries connected to our system and we have 
our officers/representatives in different countries for face-to-face person identification. 
We use best security practices and reliable open source cryptography. And it's global.

For the detailed idea and project description see:
[Cryptonomica White Paper](https://github.com/Cryptonomica/cryptonomica/wiki/Cryptonomica-White-Paper)

-------------------------------------

Cryptonomica keys server provide for it's user information about registered Cryptonomica members
and their verified public [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) keys.


## To become member of Cryptonomica:

1) Generate your [OpenPGP](https://github.com/Cryptonomica/cryptonomica/wiki/Public-PGP-Key) keys using
[recommended software](https://github.com/Cryptonomica/arbitration-rules/blob/master/Arbitration_Rules/IACC/web-site/list.of.recommended.OpenPGP.software.md).
Public PGP Key should have one user ID with fist name, last name and user e-mail.
E-mail in the key should be the same as in Google account, that You use to login to Cryptonomica server
(You can have Google account with any e-mail, or just use @gmail.com - it's not the worst choice)

We do not provide key generation, and never touch your private key,
you should generate your key on device that only you have access to,
protect it with password and never send it via Internet or public networks.

2) Press 'Register' ('Login/Register') button and login with Google account.

3) Upload your public PGP Key and information about you.

4) Verify your uploaded key.
To verify your key online find your key information page via your profile or via key search,
and click 'Verify Online' green button, then follow instructions.
For offline verification you have to contact Cryptonomica accredited notary (click 'Show notaries' tab in user menu)
or authorized Cryptonomica officer (write to support@cryptonomica.net),
and meet him/her in person, and provide appropriate documents (passport or other ID document)


### Using verified user's public key you can:

1. Verify his/her signature on contract or another legally binding documents.
Signature done with verified key is considered as user's own signature on document in arbitration tribunal
under our [Arbitration Rules](https://github.com/Cryptonomica/arbitration-rules/blob/master/Arbitration_Rules/IACC/IACC-Arbitration-Rules.EN.signed.md),
and thus such contract, agreement or obligation will be *legally* recognizable and enforceable in all counties - parties of
[The New York Convention 1958](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Recognition_and_Enforcement_of_Foreign_Arbitral_Awards) (currently [156](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Recognition_and_Enforcement_of_Foreign_Arbitral_Awards#Parties_to_the_Convention))

2. Encrypt a message (any file) to key's owner, that only he/she can decrypt it.

3. File a case for online dispute resolution in our online arbitration.
Cryptonomica Ltd. is a permanent arbitration court registered in London, U.K.,
providing online dispute resolution using modern information technologies.

To file a case just send your claim (notice of arbitration) by email to registrar@international-arbitration.org.uk
