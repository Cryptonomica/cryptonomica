                WHAT IS CRYPTONOMICA?
                Cryptonomica is the global database of verified identities with service for signing electronic documents
                and online dispute resolution.
            </p>
            <p>
                WHY IT'S USEFUL FOR ME?
                With Cryptonomica you can generate and upload your public cryptographic key (OpenPGP standard) to global
                database, and add to this key verified data about key owner, i.e. about you. Than you can use your key
                to securely sign documents worldwide, to encrypt documents, to resolve disputes online - faster and more
                comfortable than ever.
            </p>
            <p>
                HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM DOCUSIGN, ADOBESIGN, AND LOCAL DIGITAL SIGNATURE SERVICES?
                We provide real identity check. As much verification as possible. We have notaries connected to our
                system and we have our officers/representatives in different countries for face-to-face person
                identification. We use best security practices and reliable open source cryptography. And it's global.
