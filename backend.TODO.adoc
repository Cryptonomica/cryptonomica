= Backend TODO

* [x] modify code in `net.cryptonomica.servlets.CloudStorageServletVideo`

* [x] resolve:

 /#/onlineVerification/....
 Failed to load https://cryptonomica.net/gcs:
 Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check:
 No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
 Origin 'https://www.cryptonomica.net' is therefore not allowed access

(make possible to work from domain other than cryptonomica.net)

* [ ] move to last version of Bouncy Castle
